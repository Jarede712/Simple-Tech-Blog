# Simple-Tech-Blog

A simple tech blog page that lets users sign up and start posting text-only blog posts about anything tech related.

## How to start

For a project like this, following the MVC structure, a practical and effective approach is to start with the foundational setup and then progressively build up the different components. Here's a recommended sequence:

Initialize the Project and Install Dependencies:

Configure Database (config/config.js and db/schema.sql):

Set up your Sequelize configuration in config/config.js.
Create a schema.sql file in the db folder to define your MySQL database schema.
Initialize Sequelize Models (models/ folder):

Define models for your application (e.g., User.js, Post.js, Comment.js), including relationships between them.
Setup Express and Handlebars (server.js and views/ folder):

Configure your Express server in server.js. Set up Handlebars as the view engine and define middleware for parsing requests and managing sessions.
Create basic Handlebars templates (e.g., main.handlebars in views/layouts/) to get your frontend started.
Implement Basic Routing (controllers/ folder):

Start with simple routes like homeRoutes.js to serve your main page. This helps you establish the connection between your server, views, and URLs.
Static Files (public/ folder):

Set up your CSS and client-side JavaScript files. Initially, you can start with basic styling to see your server's response.
Authentication Setup:

Implement user authentication using Passport.js or similar libraries. This involves setting up routes (in controllers/) and views (in views/) for user registration, login, and logout.
Developing Further Features:

Expand your application by adding more routes, views, and models as needed (e.g., for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting blog posts and comments).
Testing and Debugging:

Continuously test your application as you develop. Start with manual testing of routes and features, and consider writing automated tests for more robust testing.
Refining and Deploying:
Once the core functionality is implemented and tested, refine your UI, perform further testing, and prepare your application for deployment.
Starting with the basic setup and progressively building up the application allows you to test and validate each component as you go, ensuring a stable and functional application. Each step builds upon the previous one, helping you manage the complexity of the project effectively.
